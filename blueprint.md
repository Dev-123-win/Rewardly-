### Endless Runner Game

A 3D endless runner game has been integrated directly into the home screen to provide an engaging way for users to earn points.

**Gameplay:**

- The player controls a character that runs endlessly through a 3D environment.
- The player can switch between three lanes to avoid obstacles and collect coins.
- The game features mobile-friendly swipe controls and keyboard controls for desktop.

**"Continue with Ad" Feature:**

- When the player collides with an obstacle, the game ends.
- A "Game Over" screen appears, offering the option to "Continue" by watching a rewarded ad.
- This ad flow is independent and does not count towards the user's daily ad limit for the main "Watch Ad" button.

**Optimized Coin Logic:**

- Coin collection is managed in a separate `coin_logic.js` file for easy configuration.
- To optimize for the Firebase free tier, the app writes to the database only after 10 coins are collected, not on every single coin.

**Graphics & Performance Enhancements:**

- **Modern UI:** The "Game Over" screen features a contemporary design with custom fonts, gradients, and interactive "glow" effects.
- **Realistic Lighting & Shadows:** The game uses a directional light to cast dynamic shadows, adding depth and realism.
- **Glow Effect:** Coins emit a vibrant glow, making them more visually appealing.
- **Varied 3D Models:** The player is a sphere, and obstacles are a mix of cylinders and boxes to break up visual monotony.
- **Dynamic Ground:** A moving grid texture enhances the sense of speed and provides a polished, sci-fi aesthetic.
- **Optimized Performance:** An object pooling system is used to reuse game objects, ensuring smooth gameplay.

## Point Economy

- **Conversion Rate:** 1000 points = â‚¹1
- **Earning Model:** Based on a 40/60 (user/admin) revenue split from an average eCPM of $1.45.

### Point Rewards per Ad

- **Bronze Tier:** 48 points
- **Silver Tier:** 54 points
- **Gold Tier:** 60 points

## Tier Promotion System

- **Daily Ad Quota:** 5 ads per day
- **Daily Ad Limit:** 10 ads per day
- **Bronze to Silver:** Maintain a 7-day streak of meeting the daily ad quota.
- **Silver to Gold:** Maintain a 30-day streak after reaching Silver.
