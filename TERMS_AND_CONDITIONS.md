# Terms and Conditions for Rewardly

**Last Updated:** July 24, 2024

Welcome to Rewardly! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Rewardly mobile application (the "App") and its services. By creating an account and using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

## 1. Accounts

- **Eligibility:** You must be at least 13 years of age to create an account and use the App.
- **Account Creation:** You must provide a valid email address to create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password.
- **One Account Per Device:** To ensure a fair system for all users, you are strictly prohibited from creating or operating more than one account on a single device. We use a unique device identifier to enforce this rule. Any attempt to circumvent this system will result in the immediate termination of all associated accounts and forfeiture of all accumulated points.

## 2. Earning Points

The App allows you to accumulate points through various methods, which can be redeemed for rewards.

- **Point Value:** The conversion rate for points to rewards is **1000 points = 1.00 Indian Rupee (INR)**. We reserve the right to change this conversion rate at any time, but we will provide notice of any such changes.

- **Sign-Up Bonus:** New users receive a standard bonus of **100 points** upon successful registration.

- **Referral Program:**
  - **For the New User (Referred):** If you sign up using a valid referral code from an existing user, you will receive an additional **250 bonus points**.
  - **For the Referrer:** When a new user successfully signs up with your referral code, you will receive a point bonus based on your current user tier:
    - **Bronze Tier:** 500 points
    - **Silver Tier:** 750 points
    - **Gold Tier:** 1000 points
  - We reserve the right to change the referral bonus structure at any time.

- **Other Activities:** Additional points may be earned through future activities such as watching advertisements or maintaining daily streaks. These will be governed by rules announced at the time they are introduced.

## 3. User Tiers

All users start at the Bronze tier. Your tier may be upgraded based on your activity and engagement within the App. Higher tiers may provide benefits such as increased referral rewards. The criteria for tier progression are determined by us and may be changed at our discretion.

## 4. Redeeming Rewards

- **Withdrawal Requests:** You may request to withdraw your accumulated points for their equivalent value in Rupees. The minimum number of points required for a withdrawal request will be stated within the App.
- **Processing:** We will process withdrawal requests in a timely manner. However, we are not responsible for delays caused by incorrect payment information provided by you or by delays from payment processors.
- **Finality:** All reward redemptions are final. Once points have been redeemed, they cannot be refunded.

## 5. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

- Use any automated system, including bots, scripts, or spiders, to create accounts, accumulate points, or otherwise interact with the App.
- Create or use multiple accounts on a single device.
- Provide false or misleading information during registration or for your payment details.
- Tamper with the App or its security features in any way.
- Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.

Violation of these rules will lead to immediate account termination and the loss of all points, without any liability to you.

## 6. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account at our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

## 7. Disclaimers

The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the operation of the App or the information, content, or materials included therein. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.

## 9. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
